# Supreme
As most of Supreme auto checkout bot is not cheap, and Supreme still has a very high demand in the market because of limited quatities. 
So I wrote this Auto Checkout Bot for one of most popular website Supreme in mid of 2018. I haven't check its website for a long time, 
hopefully they haven't done a big change.  
It used selenium library to simulate all human operation like clicking button and filling credit card infomation. People can also 
disable the types of item you dislike like "Jackets", "TopsSweaters" etc. Because Supreme website will still hold some leftover items 
which were not being sold last week, this code also support to avoid choosing those items by manually entering those URL into the code. 
Because they only have few of them, so it won't be a big task to do so.
This code will keep running until we manually kill it. You just need to change the credit card info and log directory.
